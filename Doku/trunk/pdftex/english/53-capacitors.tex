\section{Measurement of Capacitors}
The measurement of capacitor values are done as separate task by measurement of load time
after all other measurements. 
The original software of Markus F. did this with a program loop, which reads the corresponding digital input
pin until a switch occured and count the loop cycles.
This has the handicap, that the resolution of time measurement is limited by the
time consumption of one loop cycle.
This usually was done in all six combinations for all three probe pins. 
The actual software uses two different ways to get the load time in only
three combinations for the three probe pins. The positive side is now always the
higher probe number. Only if capacity is measured parallel with a diode, the
polarity can be in the other order.

\subsection{Discharging of Capacitors}
You should always discharge the capacitor before connecting it to the tester.
The tester additionally discharge the capacitor before any measurement.
If the voltage is below 1300mV, the capacitor is shortened by the output pins of the connected ADC port (Port C).
I~believe that this is legal because every output port has a built in resistance of about \(20\Omega\).
The data sheet Figure 149 (page 258) \cite{ATmega8} shows voltage drop of output pins up to 2V.
Of course I can not guaranty, that no damage can occur. 
I~have tested the function with big capacitors of more than \(15 mF\) many times and I~have never noticed any problem.
The current should be below the specified limit of 40mA and is reduced fast by discharging.
Off course damage can occur if you do not discharge a (high voltage) capacitor before connecting it to your tester.

\subsection{Measurement of big Capacitors}
\label{sec:bigcap}
One side of the capacitor is connected to GND. The other side of the capacitor is connected with the
\(680\Omega\) resistor to VCC for a period of 10ms. Afterwards this probe pin is switched to Input (High Impedance).
After this 10 ms current pulse the voltage of the capacitor is measured without any current. If the voltage has not
reached a minimal value of 300mV, the load pulse is repeated up to 499 times.
If after 127 pulses a minimum voltage of 75mV is not reached (about 2s), further load is stopped, because never
the 300mV can be reached with the remaining load pulses.
Figure~\ref{fig:bigcap} shows the three phases of measuring the capacity value of a capacitor.
The value of the capacity is then computed with the count of load pulses and the reached load voltage from a table.
The table contains  the factors to get the capacity in nF units from load time and the reached voltage
with a spacing of 25mV.
Interim value of voltage will be interpolated.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[]{../FIG/Bigcap.eps}
\caption{discharge a capacitor and load with 10ms load pulses until voltage reach a value of 300mV}
\label{fig:bigcap}
\end{figure}
As a result of the low load voltage, the measurement is much faster than the initial software version,
 because this advantage works also on discharging. So bigger capacitors can be measured.
Furthermore a diode, which is parallel connected to the capacitor don´t disturb the measurement in most cases,
because the flux voltage of most diodes is not reached.
Figure~\ref{pic:c229} shows the charge and discharge for a \(229\mu F\) capacitor.
The flat top of diagram from load end to discharge begin is caused by the measuring and computing time of the ATmega.
Figure~\ref{pic:c5mF} shows the same measurement for a~\(5mF\) capacitor,
notice how the time for measurement is grown to about 1.5 seconds inclusive the discharge. 
The last example shows the capacity measuring of a~\(15mF\) capacitor in Figure~\ref{pic:c15mF}

  \caption{Charge and discharge of a \(15mF\) Capacitor for measuring}
  \label{pic:c15mF}
\end{figure}

After this capacity measurement the self-discharge of the capacitor will be checked by
waiting a proportional period the loading has taken and reading the load voltage again.
The measured capacity value is corrected due to this voltage drop.
A test with a parallel connection of a \(68 \mu F\) capacitor and a \(2.2 k\Omega\) resistor shows
the effectivity of this method.
The measured capacity value without the resistor is \(66.5 \mu F\),
with the parallel \(2.2 k\Omega\) resistor results to a capacity value of \(66.3 \mu F\).
For comparison here are the results measured with a Peaktech 3315 multimeter:
Without the resistor a capacity value of \(68.2 \mu F\) is measured, with the
parallel \(2.2 k\Omega\) resistor a value of \(192 \mu F\) is measured with the multimeter.


\subsection{Measurement of small Capacitors}
If the first 10 ms load pulse has overloaded the capacitor, another technique of measurement is used.
The ATmega processor has a build in 16-Bit counter, which can operate at the full clock rate (1MHz or 8MHz).
This counter has also the feature to save his counter value by a external event.
This event can be built by the output of the comparator. 
The comparator can operate with any ADC input pin and the band gap reference.
Figure~\ref{fig:comparat} shows a simplified diagram of the measurement situation.
So I discharge the capacitor, prepare the comparator to the proper pin input, start the counter at 0 and
start immediately the charging of the capacitor with one side connected to GND and the other side connected with
the \(470k\Omega\) resistor to VCC.
Now I check within a program loop, if the counter flags signals a overflow event or a input capture (external) event.
I count the overflow events until I detect the input capture event.
In this case I stop the counter and check if I must count a additional overflow,
because the counter can't be stopped by the input capture event.


The input capture counter and the overflow counter built together the total time,
from which we can get the capacity with a factor.
The actual software can use a table with the theoretical  dependency of the load time in respect to the comparator voltage.
The table is spaced in 50mV steps and will be interpolated according to the actual reference voltage. 
This table will only be acticated with the Makefile option WITH\_AUTO\_REF.
From the build capacity value I subtract a predefined experimental find out constant or a value found by the last selftest
with AUTO\_CAL option to eliminate the zero offset. 
The zero offset may vary with printed board type, the used test equipment or processor.
The selftest with AUTO\_CAL option will find out your zero offset automatically.

I noticed that the reference voltage is permanently somewhat to low,
 so that you can choose an offset with the Makefile option REF\_C\_KORR.
After calibration with the AUTO\_CAL option , the REF\_C\_KORR will only be a offset to the measured difference voltage
between loaded capacitor and internal reference.
The measured reference voltage will then be corrected (added) by your value (mV units).
If option WITH\_AUTO\_REF is not used, the reference voltages of ATmega8, ATmega168 and ATmega328
are applied as noted in the data sheets~\cite{ATmega8}~\cite{ATmega168}. 
A sample measurement of this type is shown in figure~\ref{pic:c22uF}.
The measurement time for the \(22 \mu F\) capacitor is above 2.6s because the \(470k\Omega\) is
used for charging. But discharging is in this case much faster than charging.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[]{../FIG/Comparat.eps}
\caption{measurement little capacity values with comparator}
\label{fig:comparat}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[]{../PNG/charge_22uF.png}
  \caption{Charge and discharge of a \(22\mu F\) Capacitor for measuring}
  \label{pic:c22uF}
\end{figure}


In principle this technique of measurement can also be done with the \(680\Omega\) resistor, but 
because the ADC can't be used if the comparator is working, I have no chance to monitor the
load voltage until the comparator is stopped. If a undetected diode is parallel connected with
the capacitor, the load current of the capacitor can be absorbed by the diode (threshold voltage) and
the band-gap voltage will never be reached.
The method taken in actual software for big capacitors in section~\ref{sec:bigcap}
avoids this conceptual bug.

\subsection{Measurement of the Equivalent Series Resistance ESR}
The series resistance ESR \cite{ESR} is a good indicator for the aging of electrolytical capacitors for example.
The figure ~\ref{fig:Cap_equiv} shows a equivalent circuit of a capacitor.
The resistor \(Rp\) represents the leakage resistance of the capacitor, \(ESL\) the equivalent series inductivity and
the resistance \(ESR\) represents the equivalent series resistance.
If the measured capacitor has a capacity of more than \(0.45 \mu F\), the tester will try to measure
the series resistance too.
For a capacity of more than \(3.6 \mu F\) the normal clock rate of \(125 kHz\) for the Analog-Digital converter is used.
For lower capacities the higher clock rate of \(500 kHz\) is used to accelerate the measurement.
The accuracy of the ADC results will be more worth by the higher clock rate, but this could be accepted by the
higher ESR values of capacitors with lower capacity.
Otherwise the measurement of ESR with this method is not possible for a capacity of less than \(1.8 \mu F\) at the normal
clock rate of \(125 kHz\).

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[]{../FIG/Cap_equiv.eps}
  \caption{Equivalent circuit of a capacitor}
  \label{fig:Cap_equiv}
\end{figure}

Strictly speaking the ESR of a capacitor depends on the operating frequency and temperature.
Usually the value measured with sine wave-form signal of \(100 kHz\) is denoted in the data sheets.
This measurement can not be done with the ATmega without external equipment.
With the subsequent written method the measurement frequency with the standard ADC clock rate will be below 640 Hz
with nearly rectangular signal. With \(500 kHz\) ADC clock rate the measurement frequency will be 2400 Hz.
To get the value of the equivalent series resistance,
the voltage of both connections will be measured during loading in one direction with the ADC internal reference 
voltage (1.1 V).
After the measurement the load current will be switched off and the voltage of the capacitor is measured
again without the current.
If this voltage is below 3 mV, the sequence of measurement is repeated.
The figure~\ref{fig:Cap_esr} shows the corresponding circuits.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[]{../FIG/Cap_esr.eps}
  \caption{Circuit of the ESR measurements of a capacitor}
  \label{fig:Cap_esr}
\end{figure}

The difference of capacitor voltages with and without current is proportional to the internal resistance of the capacitor. 
The expected voltage of this difference is so low, that one measurement can not result to a feasible result.
Therefore after this the current will be switched to the opposite direction and the same measurement will be repeated.
The whole measurement sequence will be done 128 times and the results of the voltage measurements will be added.
So we have three sums of voltages, the voltage \(Ulp\) at the low side of the capacitor with current, the voltage \(Uhp\) at
the high side of the capacitor with current and the voltage \(Uc\) of the high side of the capacitor without current.
The sum of voltages at the low side of the capacitor represents the potential drop with the mean load current at
the port output resistance \(Rport\). 
The voltage difference  of the high side and the low side of the capacitor represents the voltage of the capacitor with
load current \(Udiff = Uhp - Ulp\).
The difference \(Uesr = Udiff - Uc\) should represent the voltage drop at the internal resistance of the capacitor with
mean load current.
We will get the resistance value with the relation of this voltage \(Uesr\) to the voltage \(Ulp\), scaled with the
known resistance value of the port output \(Rport\).
The scale factor is selected to get a resistance resolution of \(0.01 \Omega\):  \(Resr = \frac{Uesr \cdot 10 \cdot Rport}{Ulp}\)
The figure~\ref{pic:esr4} shows a part of the voltage curve of a \(4.2\mu F\) capacitor during the ESR measurement.
To explain the influence of the ESR, a series \(6.8 \Omega\) resistor is added to the capacitor.
The little voltage break after loading the capacitor is interpreted by software to get the ESR.
The greater voltage drop of the measurement to GND potential is caused by the port output resistance of about \(20 \Omega\).
For this measurement a total ESR of \(7.5 \Omega\) is reported by the tester, without the series \(6.8 \Omega\) resistor a ESR of \(0.56 \Omega\) is found.
The figure~\ref{pic:esr2} shows the same measurement with higher measurement frequency of a \(2.2 \mu F\) electrolytical capacitor
with a ESR of \(6.5 \Omega\).

  \label{pic:esr2}
\end{figure}



The accuracy of the ESR measurement is not very high by different reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The voltage measurement at both pins of the capacitor can not be done at the same time, the only way is to do it in sequence.
In the interim time between both measurements the load current has changed due to the charge of capacitor.
The program tries to compensate this fact with a capacity dependent correction of the low side voltage.
\item The ADC takes the measurement voltage after 1.5 clock ticks after the start of conversion.
The conversion beginns with the rising edge of the ADC-clock, if the start bit is set.
If the charge current will be switched off to early, the ADC takes the wrong voltage for the measurement with current.
If the charge current will be switched off to late, the capacitor will take more electric charge, than that of the
corresponding measurement with load current. This will cause a too high voltage of the measurement without current.
But it is difficult to switch off the current at the right time by software. 
\item The port output resistance is used as a reference value by this measurement method, but this resistance value is
not exacly known too.
\item The resolution of the ADC is not sufficient to get a resolution of resistance of \(0.01 \Omega\).
To get the best avaiable resolution of ADC, the internal reference (1.1 V) is used for all measurements.
The resolution deficit will be attenuated by accumulating a big number of single measurements too.
\item The switching of ports can not be exactly synchronized to the ADC clock with polling of conversion done.
\end{enumerate}

Anyway the results seems to be practical, as shown with the following figure \ref{fig:Cesr}.
The ESR values of the same part measured with the Transistortester vary more than the values measured with the LCR meter.
The ESR values from the LCR meter are measured with a frequency of 1 kHz or are interpolated for little capacities to
2.4 kHz.
You must respect the quality of all connection parts. The used cable connections can cause a higher measured resistance value.
The plug connectors can also result a higher resistance value.
The LCR meter has the advantage of the used Kelvin terminals.
Only one capacitor with a capacity below \(1 \mu F\) was a \(500 nF\) ceramic type, all others were
plastic film capacitors.
The only electrolytical capacitor of the test series below \(9 \mu F\) was a \(2.2 \mu F\) capacitor.

\subsection{Results of Capacitor measurement}
The results of my capacity measurements are shown in figure~\ref{fig:mega8cap} for three ATmega8 processors.
Additionally some values of original software are shown with a correction factor of 0.88 (-12\%).
Other measurement results of different ATmega8 versions are shown in figure~\ref{fig:mega8Acap} and \ref{fig:mega8Lcap}.
The results of the measurement of the same capacitors for a ATmega168 is shown in figure~\ref{fig:mega168cap}.
The base for the error computing are the measurement results of a PeakTech 2170 RCL-meter, not the printed value
of the parts.
A part of the relative high measurement difference is caused by the too high measurement frequency of the RCL-meter for big
electrolytical capacitors. On the other side the bad quality factor of the electrolytical capacitors may cause
another percentage.

Figure~\ref{fig:capcompare} illustrates, how difficult is it to choose the right base for the capacity measurement.
All measurement results are compared with the best estimated value of the capacitors.
The gradient ,,Multimeter'' shows the differences of the Peaktech~3315 Multimeter results.
The next gradient ,,LCR'' shows the differences of the Peaktech~2170 LCR-Meter results, which is taken from best frequency approach.
To compare this results to the results of a ATmega168 equipped Transistor-Tester the gradient ,,ATmega168as'' is also shown.
I beleave, that this errors are not real measurement errors of the particular equipment, because my best estimated value are
also not the real capacity value of the capacitors.

The differences of measurements of three different ATmega168 processors are shown in figure~\ref{fig:mega168all} .
In this case the results of the LCR~meter is taken as base of comparison.
The same results of three different ATmega168A processors are shown in figure~\ref{fig:mega168Aall} and
three different ATmega168PA processors are shown in figure~\ref{fig:mega168PAall}.
The results of three ATmega328 are additianally shown in figure~\ref{fig:mega328all} and the results from three
ATmega328P are shown in figure~\ref{fig:mega328Pall}.
At this only the zero value of the capacity measurement of 39pF is respected, all other facility to correct the results are
not used.
This zero value includes the 2-3pF, which are caused by the 12 cm long cable with the clips.
The board layout can cause a different zero value, I have fixed this zero value with the board ''DG2BRS V 5.2.1''.

To get the best accuracy you must adapt the software to the individual characteristic of your ATmega exemplar.
For this you can set a correction voltage REF\_C\_KORR for the comparator, which will be used for measurement of little capacity values.
A correction of 1~mV will reduce the measurement results to 0.11~\% .
For big capacity values you can specify with the per mill value C\_H\_KORR, how much your capacity values are measured too big.
Because the capacitors with big values are most electrolytic capacitors with worse quality factor, the measurement of
the capacity value is difficult. So it is also extra difficult to get the difference to the real value of a capacitor.

Especially with the ATmega168 processors I have noticed a anomaly of measurement results of little capacity values,
which depend on the slew rate of the voltage during loading of the capacitor.
Figure~\ref{fig:mega168optcap} shows the error of the capacity measurement when only the zero value is respected
(168-3-A), with correction factor for little capacitors REF\_C\_KORR=66 as well as the correction factor for big
capacitors C\_H\_KORR=5 (168-3-B), plus additional as gradient 168-3-C  with a model of the slew rate dependency of little capacitor 
measurements (COMP\_SLEW1=4000 und COMP\_SLEW2=220). Also the self-discharge of big capacitors is respected with gradient 168-3-C.
The component with the slew rate dependent value is computed with \(\frac{COMP\_SLEW1}{cval+COMP\_SLEW2} - \frac{COMP\_SLEW1}{COMP\_SLEW2}\),
where cval is the measured capacity value with pF units.

\caption{Improvement of the capacitor measurement of one ATmega168}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Automatic calibration of the capacitor measurement}

The automatic calibration is build in two parts. The first part find out the zero offset of the capacity measurement.
For that the mean value of the capacity measured without connected capacitor is build. 
A mean value for all 6 measurement combinations is build with 8 repetitions.
After successfull determination the zero offsets are written to the EEprom and will be used for further measurements.
More difficult was the clearance of the variance of the different ATmega processors for little capacitors (\textless \(40 \mu F\)),
which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mega168all}, \ref{fig:mega168Aall} and \ref{fig:mega168PAall}.
As a significant reason for this is found the different characteristic (Offset voltage) of the analog comparator.

The date of measurement of nine different processors is shown in figure~\ref{fig:CompAdjust} .
The ''diff2ref'' points show the difference of the voltage of a loaded capacitor of \(660 nF\) to the
individual internal reference voltages (band gap).
Ideally this difference Voltage should be zero, if the analog comparator has stopped the loading by the signal to
the processor. The short handling time of the processor should not result to a measurably rising of the 
capacitor voltage of this relative big capacitor.
The ''CapErr'' points show the estimated measurement errors of each processor out of figure~\ref{fig:mega168all}, \ref{fig:mega168Aall} 
and \ref{fig:mega168PAall} with per mill units.
It is noticeable, how the ''CapErr'' points will follow the ''diff2ref'' points.
Therefore the ''diff'' points show the difference between the particular ''CapErr'' and ''diff2ref'' points.
With a mean value of the ''diff'' points we can get a good estimation for the correction of the capacitor
measurements together with the difference voltage of the loaded capacitor and the internal reference.

For the second part of adjustment you must connect a capacitor to pin~1 and pin~3. This capacitor should have
a good quality factor and should have a capacity between \(100 nF\) and \(20 \mu F\).
It should be a film capacitor, as far as possible not a ceramic capacitor und in no case a electrolytic capacitor.
You don't need to know the exact value of this capacitor.

 shows the measurement results
of the different processors with a standard software after the auto calibration.
The flash of the processors was loaded with the same software, only the Makefile  option ''PARTNO = '' must be
adapted to the different processor type (''m168'', ''m168p'', ''m328'' or ''m328p'') for the avrdude program.
After loading the data the selftest was started for each ATmega and a capacitor with \(330 nF\) was connected
during test No.~10 to pin~1 and pin~3.

At last I will make more clear the effect of the AUTO\_CAL option in the selftest program.
The following figure~\ref{fig:MegaAuto} shows the results from the three ATmega processors
with the biggest error of measurement, one measurement before the calibration and another
measurement after the calibration.
The points marked with the ending ''unc'' shows the the errors without calibration.
The lines with the ending ''cal'' shows the error results of the {\bf same processors} 
with the {\bf same software} after the calibration in the selftest section.
The reason for the measurement errors for big capacitors \textgreater(\(40 \mu F\)) is
not yet known. All used capacitors for this series of measurements are film capacitors or
ceramic capacitors (\(56 pF\), \(100 pF\) and \(3.3 nF\)), no electrolytical capacitors are used.
