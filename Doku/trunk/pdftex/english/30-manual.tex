\section{The measurement operation}
Using of the Transistor-Tester is simple.
Anyway some hints are required.
In most cases are wires with alligator clips connected to the test ports with plugs.
Also sockets for transistors can be connected.
In either case you can connect parts with three pins to the three test ports in any order.
If your part has only two pins, you can connect this pins to any two of the tree test ports.
Normally the polarity of part is irrelevant, you can also connect pins of electrolytical capacitors in any order. 
The measurement of capacity is normally done in a way, that the minus pole is at the test port with the lower number.
But, because the measurment voltage is only between 0.3 V and at most 1.3 V, the polarity doesn\'t matter.
When the part is connected, you should not touch it during the measurement. You should put it down to a nonconducting pad
if it is not placed in a socket. You should also not touch to the isolation of wires connected with the test ports,
the measurement results can be affected.
Then you should press the start button.
After displaying a start message, the measurement result should appear after two seconds.
If capacitors are measured, the time to result can be longer corresponding to the capacity.

How the transistor-tester continues, depends on the configuration of the software.
\begin{description}
  \item[Single measurement mode] If the tester is configured for single measurement mode, the tester shut off automatical after displaying the
result for 10 seconds for a longer lifetime of battery. 
During the display time a next measurement can be started by pressing the start button.
After the shut off a next measurement can be started too of course.
The next measurement can be done with the same or another part.

  \item[Endless measurement mode] A special case is the configuration without automatical shut off.
This configuration is normally only used without the transistors for the shut off function.
A external off switch is necessary for this case. The tester will repeat measurements until power
is switched off.

  \item[Multi measurement mode] In this mode the tester will shut down not after the first measurement but 
after a configurable series of measurements. In the standard case the tester will shut down after five
measurements without found part. If any part is identified by test, the tester is shut down after double of
five (ten) measurements. A single measurement with unknown part after a series of measurement of known parts will
reset the counter of known measuerements to zero. Also a single measurement of known part will reset the counter
of unknown measurements to zero. This behavior can result in a nearly endless series of measurements without
pressing the start button, if parts are disconnected and connected in periodical manner.

In this mode there is a special feature for the display period. If the start button is pressed only short for switching
on the tester, the result of measurement ist only shown for 5 seconds. Buf if you press and hold the start button until
the first message is shown, the further measurement results are shown for 14 seconds.
The next measurement can started earlier by pressing the start button during the displaying of result.

\end{description}

\section{Selftest and Calibration}

If the software is configured with the selftest function, the selftest can be started by connecting all three
test ports together and pushing of the start button.
In this case all of the documented tests in the Selftest chapter \ref{sec:selftest} will be done.
The repetition of the tests can be avoided, if the start button is hold pressed.
So you can skip uninteresting tests fast and you can watch interresting tests by releasing the start button.

If the function AUTO\_CAL is selected in the Makefile, there will be calibrated 
the internal resistance of the port output and 
the zero offset for the capacity measurement.
It is important for the calibration task, that the connection between the three test ports is relased 
during test number 4. 
You should not touch to any of the test ports or connected cables when calibration (after test 6) is done.
But the equipment should be the same used for further measurements. Otherwise the zero offset for
capacity measurement is not detected correctly.

A capacitor with any capacity between \(100 nF\) and \(20 \mu F\) connected to pin~1 and pin~3 is
required for the last task of calibration.
To indicate that, a capacitor symbol is shown between the pin number 1 and 3, followed by the text '' >100nF''.
You should connect the capacitor not before this text is shown.
With this capacitor the offset voltage of the analog comparator will be compensated for better measurement
of capacity values.  
Additionally the gain for ADC measurements using the internal reference voltage will be adjusted too 
with the same capacitor for better resistor measurement results with the AUTOSCALE\_ADC option.

The zero offset for the ESR measurement will be preset with the option ESR\_ZERO in the Makefile.
This zero offset, which is set too high in normal case, will be preset in EEprom by the software.
With every selftest the ESR zero offset will be reset to this initial value.
After every ESR measurement the result will be checked for negative value (output of ''ESR=0?'').
In this case the zero offset will be reduced to get a zero result for next ESR measurement.
With this methode the zero offset can be adjusted with a electrolytical capacitor with high capacity value and
low ESR value.
This learned ESR zero offset remains active after power off, but the adjust procedure to get
the zero offset of ESR measurement must be done after every selftest and
in this case you should always repeat the measurement some times.

\section{special using hints}
Normally the Tester shows the battery voltage with every start. If the voltage fall below a limit,
a warning is shown behind the battery voltage. If you use a rechargeable 9V battery, you should replace
the battery as soon as possible or you should recharge.
If you use a tester with attached 2.5V precision reference, the measured supply voltage will be shown
in display row two for 1 second with ''VCC=x.xxV''.

It can not repeat often enough, that capacitors should be discharged before measuring.
Otherwise the Tester can be damaged before the start button is pressed.
If you try to measure components in assembled condition, the equipment should be allways disconnected from power source.
Furthermore you should be shure, that no residual voltage reside in the equipment.
Every electronical equipment has capacitors inside!

If you ty to measure little resistor values, you should keep the resistance of plug connectors and cables in mind.
The quality and condition of plug connectors are important, also the resistance of cables used for measurement.
The same is in force for the ESR measurement of capacitors.
With poor connection cable a ESR value of \(0.02 \Omega\) can grow to \(0.61 \Omega\).

You should not expect very good accuracy of measurement results, especially the ESR measurement and the results of inductance measurement are not very exact.
You can find the results of my test series in chapter \ref{sec:measurement}.

\section{Compoments with problems}
You should keep in mind by interpreting the measurement results, that the circuit of the TransistorTester is
designed for small signal semiconductors. In normal measurement condition the measurement current can only reach about 6 mA.
Power semiconductors often make trouble by reason of residual current with the identification an the measurement of junction capacity value.
The Tester often can not deliver enough ignition current or holding current for power Thyristors or Triacs.
So a Thyristor can be detected as NPN transistor or diode. Also it is possible, that a Thyristor or Triac is detected as unknown.

Another problem is the identification of semiconductors with integrated resistors.
So the base - emitter diode of a BU508D transistor can not be detected by reason of the parallel connected
internal \(42 \Omega\) resistor.
Therefore the transistor function can not be tested also.
Problem with detection is also given with power Darlington transistors. We can find often internal
base - emitter resistors, which make it difficult to identify the component with the undersized measurement current.
